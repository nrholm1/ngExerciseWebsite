- There seems to be a lot of redundancy in the methods that are invoked. When looking in browser console, it is obvious that the service is called a lot of times. 
This seems very inefficient. I have not even called them, it is just a byproduct of the NgInit method I believe or some other part of Angular that I don't know very deeply.
